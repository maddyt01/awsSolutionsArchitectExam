AWS Well-Architected Framework 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html

-decision-making framework for building with / on AWS
-describes best practices and strategies to use when designing + operating a cloud workload

-pillars:
  -design and operate reliable systems
  -design and operate secure systems
  -design and operate efficient systems
  -design and operate cost-effective systems
  -design and operate sustainable systems

-aws also provides Well Architected tool (cloud service) for reviewing architecture
-also includes the following general design principles ->
  -stop guessing your capacity needs 
  -test systems at production scale
  -automate with architectural experimentation in mind
  -consider evolutionary architectures
  -drive architectures using data
  -improve through game days (simulate events in production)
-organization, prepare, operate, evolve

  Pillar 1: Operational Excellence
  -commitment to build software correctly 
  -deliver great customer experience
  -team organization, workload design, operating at scale, evolution
    -organize teams around business outcomes 
    -implement observability for actionable insights (collect data about key metrics and use it to take action)
    -safely automate where possible (reduce undifferentiated heavy lifting)
    -make frequent, small, reversible changes (scalable, loosely coupled workloads allow for faster adaptation)
    -refine operations procedure frequently (continous improvement)
    -anticipate failure (simulate failure to understand risks)
    -use managed services (aws managed services reduce operational overhead)

AWS Cloud Adoption Framework
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/overview-aws-cloud-adoption-framework/welcome.html



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS Services:

EC2 (aka elastic compute cloud)
-AWS fundamental compute service
-billed/charged based on instance type and compute used by the second
-Rent virtual machines in the cloud
-use EBS to store data on virtual drives in the cloud
-Scale with auto scaling group
-User Data is used to bootstrap (run commands for setup) an EC2 instance
  -script only run once, at the first start of instance
  -install updates, install software, download common files from the internet, etc.
  -run with root user priveleges by default
-Can attach elastic IP ->
  -if you need a consistent IP address when an instance is repeatedly stopped and started
  -public IP that the user owns as long as they want
  -mask instance failure by rapidly remapping the address to another instance
  -soft limit of 5 elastic IPs 
  -avoid when possible (use random public IP + DNS name)
-Multiple instance types ->
  -On-demand Instances
    -short workload, predictable pricing
  -Reserved
    -known amount of time, a year or longer
    -long term commitment
    -use for steady state usage applications (ex. database)
      -convertible reserved instances == long workloads with flexible instance types
      -scheduled reserved instances == instances reserved for a longer period used on a set schedule
  -Spot Instances == short workloads, can be interrupted, risk of losing instance, cheaper
    -use with failure resilient workloads
    -name your price, buy if its within your price range (giving stocks)
      -persistent requests (want to maintain n instances as long as request is active)
      -one time requests (request goes away once its fulfilled)
    -can cancel open / active / disabled instance requests
    -cancelling a request does not terminate launched instances; must cancel the request and then terminate associated instances
  -Dedicated Instances == private / personal underlying hardware for amazon account/organization
  -Dedicated Hosts == book an entire physical server, gain access to controlling physical placement of instances
-AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
  -region-locked
  -can pre-install packages, boot faster, active directory etc.
  -EC2 instance configuration / template
  -can share AMI cross account
  -public AMIs / can rent AMI from AWS Marketplace
  -"golden AMI"
-Instance placement Groups
  -Cluster == low latency group in a single AZ
    -good for networking, big data jobs, high speed, extremely low latency, high network throughput
  -Spread == spread instances across underlying hardware (7 instances / group / AZ)
    -can span multiple AZs, reduce risk of simultaneous failure
    -application that needs to maximize high availability, 
    -mission-critical applications + isolating each instance from failure
  -Partition == Spread instances across many different paritions / sets of racks within an AZ
    -Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka
    -up to 7 partitions / AZ
    -hundreds of EC2 instances / AZ
    -HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka
-ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
  -Virtual network card
  -can have the following attributes:   
    -primary private IPv4 address
    -1+ secondary IPv4 addresses
    -1 elastic IP / private IPv4
    -1 public IPv4
  -can be created independently from EC2 instances
  -can be transferred between EC2 instances
  -bound to specific available zone
  -can have security groups attached to them
    -EC2 instances have primary ENI (eth0), can attach a secondary ENI (making eth1 interface available)
-EC2 Hibernate
  -additional instance state to stopped / terminated state
  -pause instance, all data from RAM is preserved
  -instance boot is faster
  -root EBS volume must be encrypted


Lambda
-build serverless / microservices application
-run time >15 minutes
-functions

ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)
-2 kinds of load balncers for creating highly avaliable systems
-Application Load Balancer (ALB): http 
-Network Load Balancer (NLB): high performance, non http (gaming, udp)

Auto Scaling
-ASG (Auto Scaling Group)

EBS (Elastic Block Store)
-block storage
-ec2 primary storage solution

S3 (aka simple storage service)
-object storage
-different tiers, infrequent access, glacier, etc.
-storing content, static websites, photos, etc.
-transition between storage tiers with life cycle policies 

Storage Gateway
-storage service

RDS (aka relational database service)
-supports multiple db engines including Amazon Aurora
-Amazon Aurora
-PostGreSql
-Microsoft SQL server
-My SQL

DynamoDB
-No SQL database
-fully managed -> aka serverless 
ECS (aka elastic container service)

Elasticache
-redis / memcached
-not for content delivery
-improve data throughput

Redshift:
-Data lake / warehouse
-data storage and analytics
-petabyte scale

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

NACL (aka Network Access Control List)

Security Groups
-aws firewalls essentially
-fundamental networking security in AWS 
-control port access, EC2 i/o traffic
-support IPv4 and IPv6
-can attach to multiple instances at once
-region+vpc level / locked
-"live" outside EC2 instances-- EC2 instance cannot see group if traffic is blocked
-best practice is to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
-request for application times out ? probably a security group issue
-request response == connection refused ? traffic went through the security group, it is an application error
-default behavior == all inbound traffic blocked, all outbound traffic allowed
-security group can allow traffic from another security group
-security groups can reference eachother, 
so no need to reference IP of the instance to which a security group is attached


Route 53 
-DNS routing
-translate www.example.com into IP address
-Alias Records
-CName Records

IAM (aka Identity and Access Management)
-users -> individual users
-groups -> assign users to group (ex. admin group)
-policies -> attach policies to users, groups and rules to give permissions
-roles -> temporary/short term credentials

Cloudwatch
-AWS monitoring
-CloudWatch Logs 
-Alarms
-Custom metrics with CloudWatch Agent 

Cloudtrail
-logging

Kinesis
-real time data
-Kinesis Data Streams
-Kinesis Firehose
-Kinesis sharding

Cloudfront
-CDN (Content Delivery Network)
-accelerate websites
-content sources include: 

SQS (aka Simple Queue Service)
-decouple applications
-fifo queue vs standard queue

SNS (Simple Notification Service)
-another service used for decoupling

CloudFormation
-templates and configurations

AWS Global Accelerator

EFA (aka elastic fabric adapter)
-next level up of ENA (elastic network adapter)
-big data
